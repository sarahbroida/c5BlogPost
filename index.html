        <h3>The Sims 4 and its relationship to UX Design</h3>

        <p>The Sims 4 is my favorite game of all time. It combines elements of pretend play (something I was never good at as a kid) with the visuals of a 3D simulator, plus features for interior design, fashion, and fantastic potential for open ended play and epic storylines. I have worlds with families of sims I’ve played for generations, each heir with their own unique storyline, outfits, personality, and drama. It’s fascinating how much I can dissolve into this world I’ve created and watch my own ambitions and ideas come to life, all while documenting them on a little fake camera my sim takes selfies with. It’s truly a mimic of life in a lot of ways, and I’m so glad I get so much enjoyment out of a game on my free time. </p>
        <p>This does not mean, however, that the Sims 4 is free of flaws. The game itself seems to barely be playable at times, with new glitches being discovered daily and most users having to find workarounds for a multitude of obstacles they face in the gameplay. I can find hundreds of ideas from fans pleading for additions constantly, from something as simple as a new wallpaper to as complex as working cars. I think the situations I’ve laid out can all be summed up to a message about game production, but it can also act as a message about UX design and life itself. </p>
        <p>For example, one of my favorite aspects of the game is the build mode, where you can create incredibly detailed houses and just about any other structure you can think of, but even the build mode is lacking in some areas. For instance, there are no outlets you can place in the game; something essential to most modern houses and builds. UX design carries a similar weight, where simple actions in real life can easily end up lacking in our virtual world. But that doesn’t mean the game is any less enjoyable for the most part. I still find myself putting in many hours into this game, flaws and all, because I enjoy the core concept and I find most of the gameplay challenges stimulating. Additionally, I have noticed people reach a new level of creativity when faced with these sorts of obstacles. I’m not saying UX design should attempt to make things difficult on the user, because in fact that’s usually the opposite of the goal, but I also want to mindful of the idea that people are willing to put effort in. The real goal of UX is to make most of the functionality straightforward, understandable, and functional, so a user can complete a task and not get frustrated doing that. But it’s more than that. We want to create foundations in which people can be creative, problem solve, and use our products in ways we wouldn’t have thought of. That’s one my favorite things about open-ended games like The Sims 4 and Minecraft. I still believe the best user experience is one intuitive enough for a user to feel like they already know how to utilize the interface, but I also love the idea that humans, when faced with challenges, persevere. </p>  
        <p>In summary, that’s what I love about UX design - the human aspect. You’re designing for a community. And like The Sims 4 and like UX design, life can be quite a challenge at times, but it’s important to remember those entertaining moments as best you can, because eventually you will reach a new challenge. Luckily, pushing the boundaries of your abilities and flexing your creativity to overcome obstacles is what life is all about. </p>
